# MILP_cryptanalysis

In this project, I try to build some MITM models to found the best possible truncated differential MITM attack on various primitives

For each primitives, there is a specific folder containing :
- the MILP modelisation for truncated differential attack (MILP_trunc_diff_MITM)
- A file 'display-attack' that search the best attack for some specific parameters and display it
- A file 'Best_search_attack' wich search for the optimal attacks in the range of parameters of the file 'parameters'

To use thoose programs refer to the READ ME in each folder
