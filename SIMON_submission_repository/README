# MILP Model to find key recovery of Differential Meet-in-the-middle attack on Simon like cipher.

### Content of the folder :
- main.py <-- *3-LAUNCH* this file to search fo an attack.

- MILP_model_diff_MITM_SIMONlike.py : contains the complete MILP model.

- gurobi_licence.py <-- *1-COMPLETE* this file with your own licence.

- display.py : contains the display funtion

- parameters_folder
    - your_parameters <-- *2-COMPLETE* this file your own attack parameters
    - other are provided, these are the parameters files used to found the attack described in the paper, you can use as example to complete the 'your_parameters' file. If you want to run a search for optimal attack with one of this model, change all the occurence of 'you_parameters' in the main function by the name of the file you want to test.

- figure_folder : containts the generated figure pdf images, initially contains all the attack figures used in the paper.

### Search for an attack :
    Step 1 : COMPLETE the gurobi_licence file.
    Step 2 : COMPLETE the your_parameters file or change the parameters file in the main file (line 9).
    Step 3 : LAUNCH the main.py() file.
    Step 4 : The results are displayed in the terminal, a pdf picture is generated if asked in the parameter file.
